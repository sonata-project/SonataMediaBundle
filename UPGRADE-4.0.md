UPGRADE FROM 3.x to 4.0
=======================

## Deprecations

All the deprecated code introduced on 3.x is removed on 4.0.

Please read [3.x](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataMediaBundle/tree/3.x) upgrade guides for more information.

See also the [diff code](https://github.com/sonata-project/SonataMediaBundle/compare/3.x...4.0.0).

## Blocks

The property `wrap` in `GalleryBlockService` was removed. You must create a custom block, if you still want to use ist.

## BaseVideoProvider

The `Buzz` dependency was removed and replaced with `GuzzleHttp`. You must adapt the new `BaseVideoProvider::__construct` signature.
