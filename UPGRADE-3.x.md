UPGRADE FROM 3.x to 3.x
=======================

### Deprecate `null` media value on Twig functions

Our custom twig functions (`sonata_media`, `sonata_thumbnail` and `sonata_path`) used to accept a null value and produce an empty result.

This is deprecated and you should make sure you check for null before calling those functions.

### Deprecated `MigrateToJsonTypeCommand`

This command was introduced a long time ago to migrate from array to json. Make sure you migrate it before upgrading to SonataMediaBundle 4.0.

### Deprecated `ServiceProviderDataTransformer`

This class is deprecated because it is dead code. If you use it, please use `ProviderDataTransformer` instead.

UPGRADE FROM 3.33 to 3.34
=========================

### Deprecated custom Twig tags in favour of Twig functions

The following custom twig tags are now deprecated and replaced with functions.

Before:

```twig
    {% media media, 'large' with {'sizes': '(min-width: 20em) 50vw, 100vw'} %}
    {% thumbnail media, 'small' %}
    {% path media, 'small' %}
```

After:

```twig
    {{ sonata_media(media, 'large', {'sizes': '(min-width: 20em) 50vw, 100vw'}) }}
    {{ sonata_thumbnail(media, 'small') }}
    {{ sonata_path(media, 'small') }}
```

### Deprecate Async processing with SonataNotificationBundle

Integration with SonataNotificationBundle is deprecated. It was used for async processing of thumbnail generation.

You can use the new integration with [Symfony Messenger](https://symfony.com/doc/current/messenger.html) instead.

### Deprecate API

Integration with FOSRest, JMS Serializer and Nelmio Api Docs is deprecated, the ReST API provided with this bundle will be removed on 4.0.

If you are relying on this, consider moving to other solution like [API Platform](https://api-platform.com/) instead.

### Deprecate Pixlr integration

Integration with Pixlr is deprecated now. There is no replacement since
the bundle is trying to focus on media management and not on the edit part.

### Media and Gallery Controllers

`viewAction()` and `indexAction()` from media and gallery controllers are deprecated now.
There is no provided replacement since those actions are suposed to be implemented in app side if you need them.

### Breadcrumbs classes

Breadcrumbs are deprecated, if your application uses them on the frontend side, you should use `sonata-project/seo-bundle` to implement them instead.

UPGRADE FROM 3.32 to 3.33
=========================

### Sonata\MediaBundle\Listener\BaseMediaEventSubscriber::getMedia() and its inheritances

Method `getMedia()` returns `null` if the related medium does not implement `Sonata\MediaBundle\Model\MediaInterface`.

### Sonata\MediaBundle\Thumbnail\ResizableThumbnailInterface

This interface is added to provide a clearer API for `FormatThumbnail`. It allows to know if a `Thumbnail` object can be generated with custom `Resizer` instances, not the ones provided by
the file provider.

If you have custom `Thumbnail` generator, please implement this interface if you need
custom resizers.

### Deprecate OpenStack / Rackspace integration

This integration is deprecated because the php packages are not up to date. On master
this integration will be removed. There is no replacement for it.

### Deprecate direct session injection

The `Guzzle` and `Buzz` dependencies are deprecated and will be replaced with the abstract `http-client` interface, so you can choose your preferred client implementation. You should adapt to the new `BaseVideoProvider::__construct()` signature.

UPGRADE FROM 3.25 to 3.26

### Commands

Command classes were updated to inherit from `Command` instead of deprecated `ContainerAwareCommand`. Direct access to container will
